# use SCA #5 as default for pixel scale etc. - has intermediate characteristics
# if keyword sca is not defined, or is 0, then use analytic calculation for WFE.
#   (indicate this by setting fov = 0)
# otherwise fov is used to specify which PSF file to read in
# sca_id is used in the parameter structures to indicate which SCA was specified by the user.
# sca_id runs from 1-18
# sca_index is used to specify the pixel scale, focal length, SCA tilt WRT gut ray, etc.
# sca_index specifies which pupil obscuration factor to use - can choose something different later.
# sca_index runs from 0-17
